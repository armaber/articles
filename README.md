The articles are written as lunch break discussions, with emphasys on accesibility
and fluency. Attention to details does matter when wandering. To some degree, one
has to be versed in the techology and spend brain cycles in what is relevant.

Many of the topics dive into Windows, as an OS: infrastructure, kernel, features,
or tools.

Configuration, administrative tasks are side dishes. I strive for accuracy of the
main ideas. Everything, or so I claim, is backed by testing; small and tedious
proofs can go unmentioned.

Here's the first topic:

Upcoming:
- *HeavyDutyUF*: disassemble the kernel to build a call tree for a chosen symbol.
